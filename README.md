# Study Tracker

A Python program that logs daily study hours and generates a summary report.

## Features
- Stores study sessions in a text file
- Calculates total and average study time
- Handles missing files safely

## Why I Built This
I wanted a simple way to track consistency and practice file handling in Python.
